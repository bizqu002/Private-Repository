Link to access my web application: http://ocelot.aul.fiu.edu:5276/main.jsp

To build the website, the first file that I use is the main.jsp which displays the login page.
From the login page, there is a link to log out. If the user enters a valid username and password, 
then he or she is directed to the home page, which is the checkLogin.jsp file.

From the main page, there is a link to each one of the four tables: students, faculties, enroll, and courses.
There is also a link to logout (logout.jsp) or to go to www.cis.fiu.edu.

students.jsp -> displays the students table and the search (main.jsp), delete (main4.jsp), 
		insert (main8.jsp), and update (main12.jsp) options.  
faculties.jsp -> displays the faculties table and the search (main2.jsp), delete (main5.jsp), 
		insert (main9.jsp), and update (main13.jsp) options.  
courses.jsp -> displays the courses table and the search (main3.jsp), delete (main7.jsp), 
		insert (main11.jsp), and update (main14.jsp) options.  
enroll.jsp -> displays the students table and the delete (main6.jsp), insert (main10.jsp), 
		and update (main15.jsp) options.

Each of the four database jsp files has a button to reload the webpage. 
Each of these main files has links to either go back to the home page, the previous page, or to logout.
